Flex MVP Framework
==================

A Model-View-Presenter framework used to abstract away the various component lifecycle phases that exist in every Flex application while providing a clean API for handling view behavior and updating the view based on changes to the model. The framework also makes it trivial to react to the various component lifecycle phases without needing to know their corresponding event names.
